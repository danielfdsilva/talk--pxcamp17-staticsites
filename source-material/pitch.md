Description
-----------

Static sites are nothing new.
The internet started with static websites until we realized there was a better alternative and started building CMS that just grew bigger and more complex
Now static sites are a reality again. They are the alternative: easy to manage, simple to edit, cheap to host.
In this talk I'm going over building a simple static website and a set of tools to manage it: [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) to handle the site generation, [prose.io](http://prose.io/) as a powerful content editor, [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a free hosting solution and [cicleci](https://circleci.com/) for some tests (`echo "All ok!" && exit 0` ;)) and to ensure everything gets deployed without the need to move a finger.  


Speaker Bio
-----------

I am Daniel da Silva, a web developer based in Lisbon and currently working at Development Seed.
I really like the web and all the bits and pieces - from systems' administration to user interaction - that make it tick.

I'm a very technical guy and when not measuring the world with arduinos and sensors, you can find me running around, geocaching, snapping pictures, or watching movies.

Oh, and I also love a good cup o' joe, especially Delta.
